## About this fork
This fork aims to improve AltoClef by adding support to collect need matriaials for a schmatic. 

## The preprocessor
I am currently using the [replay mod preprocessor](https://github.com/ReplayMod/preprocessor) to keep the mod updated across multiple versions at the same time.

### Versions
Thanks to that, the mod is currently available on **fabric** for the following versions:
- 1.20.1
- 1.20.2
- 1.20.4
- 1.20.5
- 1.20.6

*note: All of the versions use the "same release" of Altoclef, altough some of them use older versions of baritone.* 


## How it works

Take a look at this [Guide from the wiki](https://github.com/MiranCZ/altoclef/wiki/1:-Documentation:-Big-Picture)
or this [Video explanation](https://youtu.be/q5OmcinQ2ck?t=387)


## Download

**Note:** After installing, please move/delete your old baritone configurations if you have any. Preexisting baritone
configurations will interfere with altoclef and introduce bugs. This will be fixed in the future.
